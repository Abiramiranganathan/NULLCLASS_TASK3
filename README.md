# NULLCLASS_TASK3
DATA SCIENCE
Description:
Task 3 focused on integrating sentiment analysis into a chatbot so it can detect and respond appropriately to customer emotions during interactions. Using the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset, the raw reviews were cleaned, preprocessed, and labeled as positive, negative, or neutral based on the review score. A TF-IDF vectorizer converted the text into numerical features, and a Logistic Regression model was trained for sentiment classification, achieving an accuracy of 87%. The trained model was then integrated into a chatbot that responds with empathetic, encouraging, or neutral messages depending on the detected sentiment. This enhancement allows the chatbot to better engage with users and improve customer satisfaction by adapting its tone to match the userâ€™s emotions.
